# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement the feature where a user can select a server in the `ConnectServerPage.vue` component and click connect to open a new tab with a web terminal that automatically logs into the remote server via SSH, without exposing the SSH key to the user.

## 1. Security Enhancement

*   **Goal:** Encrypt SSH keys in the database.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Modify the backend to use a secure encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) to encrypt SSH keys before storing them in the database.
    *   Implement a key management system to securely store the encryption key.
    *   Update the backend code to decrypt the SSH keys when needed.
    *   Implement a mechanism for rotating encryption keys regularly.
    *   Store the encryption key in a secure environment variable, not directly in the code.

## 2. Backend API Endpoint

*   **Goal:** Create a new API endpoint for establishing SSH connections.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Create a new API endpoint in the backend (e.g., `/api/connect_server`).
    *   The endpoint should accept the server ID as a parameter.
    *   The endpoint should:
        *   Retrieve the server information from the database.
        *   Retrieve the SSH key from the database (decrypting it first).
        *   Check if the user has permission to connect to the server.
        *   Establish an SSH connection to the remote server using the SSH key.
        *   Return a WebSocket URL to the client.

## 3. Frontend Modifications

*   **Goal:** Modify the `ConnectServerPage.vue` and `TerminalPage.vue` components.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **ConnectServerPage.vue:**
        *   Modify the component to open a new tab with the `TerminalPage.vue` component when the user clicks the "Connect" button.
        *   Pass the selected server ID to the `TerminalPage.vue` component as a query parameter.
    *   **TerminalPage.vue:**
        *   Retrieve the server ID from the query parameters.
        *   Call the backend API endpoint (`/api/connect_server`) with the server ID.
        *   Establish a WebSocket connection to the URL returned by the API endpoint.
        *   Use Xterm.js to display the terminal output.

## 4. Permission Control

*   **Goal:** Ensure that only authorized users can connect to the servers.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The backend API endpoint should check if the user has permission to connect to the server before establishing the SSH connection.
    *   Use the existing role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism to determine the user's permissions.

## 5. Documentation

*   **Goal:** Update the documentation to reflect the changes.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Update the README.md file to describe the new functionality.
    *   Update the API documentation to describe the new API endpoint.

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Goal:** Implement standard security best practices.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection attacks.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
